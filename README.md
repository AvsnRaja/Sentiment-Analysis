# News Based Sentiment-Analysis for Stock Investment
The project focuses on finding sentiments of financial news and demonstrating correlation between the sentiments of the financial news and stock price variation.  Modern behavioural finance recognizes both sentimental investors and rational investors. Manually reading the news and labelling it as positive or negative is a very tedious task. Moreover, manual evaluation of news may not be completely objective due to the factors like reader bias, emotion and fatigue. Automatic sentiment analysis can avoid these pitfalls.
